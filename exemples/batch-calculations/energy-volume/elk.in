! Elk can run a batch of calculations while varying a particular input
! parameter.

! In this example, we use this feature to generate an energy-volume curve of
! AlAs. Only certain variables can be varied but more can be added on request.
! The output data is stored in a standard format in the file VARIABLES.OUT.

! To extract the set of volumes use:
!
!   sed -n '/omega/{n;n;p}' VARIABLES.OUT > omega
!
! and to extract the corresponding total energies use:
!
!   sed -n '/engytot/{n;n;p}' VARIABLES.OUT > engytot
!
! These can be combined into a single file using:
!
!   paste omega engytot > e_vs_v
!
! which can be plotted or fitted to an equation of state.


! run several consecutive ground-state calculations
