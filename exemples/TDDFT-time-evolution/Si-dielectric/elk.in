! Dielectric function of silicon calculated using real-time evolution. This is
! done with task=481 which assumes that the A-field is constant in time. The
! corresponding electric field is thus proportional to a delta function at t=0
! and its Fourier transform is a constant in frequency.

! Note that task=480 calculates the same but without assuming that the A-field
! is constant in time. This requires computing J(w)/E(w) which is numerically
! less stable than that obtained with task=481.

! Make a plot of JTOT_TD.OUT to see how the total current in the unit cell
! varies over time.

! Task 481 requires a constant A-field which should be small enough to remain
! in the linear regime. This can be done by using a laser pulse of zero
! frequency but with a full-width at half-maximum which is much larger than the
! total simulation time (tstime). The phase should be set to 90° to ensure that
! the pulse is of the form cos(ωt).
