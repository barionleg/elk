! US in FM structure with magnetic moment along easy-axis [111] with LDA+SOC+U
! around mean field (AFM) (dftu=2). Values of Slater parameters for Uranium are
! calculated through a Yukawa potential with screening length automatically
! determined such that U=1.0 eV (0.036749 Ha). In this way there is only one
! free parameter to be chosen.

! Check the tensor moment decomposition of the density matrix in TENSMOM.OUT
! (see PRB 80, 035121 (2009)). Observe the large 011 (spin-polarization),
! 110 (SOC-like term) and 615 (large multipole of magnetization density).

! Example by Francesco Cricchio.
